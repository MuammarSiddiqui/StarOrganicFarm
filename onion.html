                     The onion (Allium cepa L., from Latin cepa "onion"), also known as the bulb onion or common onion,
                     is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. Its close relatives
                     include the garlic, scallion, shallot, leek, chive,[2] and Chinese onion.[3]

                     This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for
                     food, such as the Japanese bunching onion (Allium fistulosum), the tree onion (A. ×proliferum), and
                     the Canada onion (Allium canadense). The name "wild onion" is applied to a number of Allium
                     species, but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not
                     known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.[4] The onion is
                     most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested
                     in its first growing season.
