                     Olive oil is a liquid fat obtained from olives (the fruit of Olea europaea; family Oleaceae), a
                     traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin, produced by pressing whole olives and extracting
                     the oil. It is commonly used in cooking, for frying foods or as a salad dressing. It is also used
                     in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps, and has
                     additional uses in some religions. The olive is one of three core food plants in Mediterranean
                     cuisine; the other two are wheat and grapes. Olive trees have been grown around the Mediterranean
                     since the 8th millennium BC.

                     The top five producers of olive oil by volume are Spain, Morocco, Turkey, Greece, and Italy. Per
                     capita consumption is highest in Greece, followed by Spain and Italy.

                     The composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar, altitude, time of harvest and extraction
                     process. It consists mainly of oleic acid (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids
                     including linoleic acid (up to 21%) and palmitic acid (up to 20%). Extra virgin olive oil is
                     required to have no more than 0.8% free acidity and is considered to have favorable flavor
                     characteristics.
