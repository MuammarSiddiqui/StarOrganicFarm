                     Black rice is a range of rice types of the species Oryza sativa, some of which are glutinous rice.
                     Black rice is also known as 'Forbidden Rice' in ancient China since only those belonging to the
                     upper class could afford to eat it.[1]

                     There are several varieties of black rice available today. These include Indonesian black rice,
                     Philippine balatinaw rice,[2] and Thai jasmine black rice. Black rice is known as chak-hao in
                     Manipur, where desserts made from black rice are served at major feasts.

                     In Bangladesh it is known as kalo dhaner chaal (black paddy rice) and used to make polao or
                     rice-based desserts. The bran hull (outermost layer) of black rice contains one of the highest
                     levels of anthocyanins found in food.[3] The grain has a similar amount of fiber to brown rice and,
                     like brown rice, has a mild, nutty taste.
