                     Grape seed oil (also called grapeseed oil or grape oil) is a vegetable oil derived from the seeds
                     of grapes. A by-product of the winemaking industry, it is typically used for edible applications.
                     Grape seed oil has a moderately high smoke point of approximately 216 °C (421 °F). Due to its
                     clean, light taste, and high polyunsaturated fat content, it may be used as an ingredient in salad
                     dressings and mayonnaise and as a base for oil infusions of garlic, rosemary, or other herbs or
                     spices. It is widely used in baked goods, pancakes, and waffles. It is sprayed on raisins to help
                     them retain their flavor.
