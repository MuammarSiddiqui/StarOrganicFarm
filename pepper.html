                     The chili pepper (also chile, chile pepper, chilli pepper, or chilli[3]), from Nahuatl chīlli
                     (Nahuatl pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃiːlːi] (About this soundlisten)), is the fruit of plants from the
                     genus Capsicum which are members of the nightshade family, Solanaceae.[4] Chili peppers are widely
                     used in many cuisines as a spice to add heat to dishes. The substances giving chili peppers their
                     intensity when ingested or applied topically are capsaicin and related compounds known as
                     capsaicinoids.

                     Chili peppers originated in Mexico.[5] After the Columbian Exchange, many cultivars of chili pepper
                     spread across the world, used for both food and traditional medicine. This diversity has lead to a
                     wide variety of varieties and cultivars, including the annuum species, with its glabriusculum
                     variety and New Mexico cultivar group, and the species of baccatum, chinense, frutescens, and
                     pubescens.
