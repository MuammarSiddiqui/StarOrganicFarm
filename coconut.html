                     Coconut oil (or coconut butter) is a plant oil derived from the kernels, meat, and milk of the
                     coconut palm and fruit.[1] It is used as a food oil, and in industrial applications.[1] It has high
                     levels of saturated fat, causing some health authorities to recommend limiting consumption of
                     coconut oil as a food.
                     Proper harvesting of the coconut (the age of a coconut can be 2 to 20 months when picked) makes a
                     significant difference in the efficacy of the oil-making process. Copra made from immature nuts is
                     more difficult to work with and produces an inferior product with lower yields.
                     A thousand mature coconuts weighing approximately 1,440 kilograms (3,170 lb)[clarification needed]
                     yield around 170 kilograms (370 lb) of copra from which around 70 litres (15 imp gal) of coconut
                     oil can be extracted۔
