                     Cloves are the aromatic flower buds of a tree in the family Myrtaceae, Syzygium aromaticum. They
                     are native to the Maluku Islands (or Moluccas) in Indonesia, and are commonly used as a spice.[2]
                     Cloves are available throughout the year owing to different harvest seasons in different countries.
                     Cloves are used in the cuisine of Asian, African, Mediterranean, and the Near and Middle East
                     countries, lending flavor to meats, curries, and marinades, as well as fruit (such as apples,
                     pears, and rhubarb). Cloves may be used to give aromatic and flavor qualities to hot beverages,
                     often combined with other ingredients such as lemon and sugar. They are a common element in spice
                     blends, including pumpkin pie spice and speculoos spices.

                     In Mexican cuisine, cloves are best known as clavos de olor, and often accompany cumin and
                     cinnamon.[4] They are also used in Peruvian cuisine, in a wide variety of dishes such as carapulcra
                     and arroz con leche.The spice is used in a type of cigarette called kretek in Indonesia.[1] Clove
                     cigarettes have been smoked throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States. Since 2009, clove
                     cigarettes have been classified as cigars in the US.[6]

                     Because of the bioactive chemicals of clove, the spice may be used as an ant repellent.[7]

                     Cloves can be used to make a fragrant pomander when combined with an orange. When given as a gift
                     in Victorian England, such a pomander indicated warmth of feeling.
