                     A rusk is a hard, dry biscuit or a twice-baked bread.[1] It is sometimes used as a teether for
                     babies.[2] In some cultures, rusk is made of cake, rather than bread: this is sometimes referred to
                     as cake rusk. In the UK, the name also refers to a wheat-based food additive.Rusk is called sukhary
                     (Azerbaijani: suxarı - a loanword from Russian) in Azerbaijani. It is usually (but not always) made
                     from stale bread and buns. In Baku, some bakeries use their stale buns and bread for making rusks.
                     The price of rusk in those bakeries is usually low, as the bakeries do this to avoid wasting the
                     leftover bread and buns.
