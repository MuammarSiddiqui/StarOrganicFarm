                     The pea is most commonly the small spherical seed or the seed-pod of the pod fruit Pisum sativum.
                     Each pod contains several peas, which can be green or yellow. Botanically, pea pods are fruit,[2]
                     since they contain seeds and develop from the ovary of a (pea) flower. The name is also used to
                     describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea
                     (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus.

                     P. sativum is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool-season crop grown in
                     many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location.
                     The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 gram.
