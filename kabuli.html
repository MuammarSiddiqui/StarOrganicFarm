                     Kabuli Chickpeas are nutritional powerhouses loaded with fibre, protein and nutrients. Kabuli’s are
                     known for their large size, creamy colour and smooth coat. When soaked and boiled, these dried
                     pulses cook up tastier and creamier than their cousins from a can.

                     To cook, soak the beans in clean water for 12-24 hours. Rinse well and cover with cold water. Bring
                     to a boil and cook for 60 minutes or until chickpeas are soft and creamy.

                     Our Kabuli Chickpeas are perfect for salads, curries, and the creamiest hummus ever.

                     To keep our products at their best, store in a sealed container in a cool, dark place.
                     There's nothing better than having a batch of chickpeas on hand to whip up your favourite recipes! We love this...
