                     The potato is a root vegetable native to the Americas, a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum
                     tuberosum, and the plant itself is a perennial in the nightshade family, Solanaceae.[2]

                     Wild potato species, originating in modern-day Peru, can be found throughout the Americas, from
                     Canada to southern Chile.[3] The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by
                     indigenous peoples of the Americas independently in multiple locations,[4] but later genetic
                     testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species traced a single origin for potatoes. In
                     the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the
                     Solanum brevicaule complex, potatoes were domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years
                     ago.[5][6][7] In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close
                     relatives of the potato are cultivated.
