                     Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple
                     food.[2][3][4] The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown
                     is common wheat (T. aestivum). The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated
                     in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of
                     fruit called a caryopsis.

                     Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014).[5] World
                     trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.[6] In 2017, world production of wheat
                     was 772 million tonnes, with a forecast of 2019 production at 766 million tonnes,[7] making it the
                     second most-produced cereal after maize.[7][8] Since 1960, world production of wheat and other
                     grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century.
