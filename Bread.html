                     Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. Throughout
                     recorded history, it has been a prominent food in large parts of the world. It is one of the oldest
                     man-made foods, having been of significant importance since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an
                     essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.

                     Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes, chemicals, industrially produced yeast, or
                     high-pressure aeration. In many countries, commercial bread often contains additives to improve
                     flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.
