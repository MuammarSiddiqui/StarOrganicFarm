                     Nutmeg is the seed or ground spice of several species of the genus Myristica.[1] Myristica fragrans
                     (fragrant nutmeg or true nutmeg) is a dark-leaved evergreen tree cultivated for two spices derived
                     from its fruit: nutmeg, from its seed, and mace, from the seed covering. It is also a commercial
                     source of an essential oil and nutmeg butter. The California nutmeg, Torreya californica, has a
                     seed of similar appearance, but is not closely related to Myristica fragrans, and is not used as a
                     spice. Indonesia is the main producer of nutmeg and mace.If consumed in amounts exceeding its typical use as a spice, nutmeg powder may produce allergic reactions, cause contact dermatitis, or have psychoactive effects.[2] Although used in traditional medicine for treating various disorders, nutmeg has no scientifically confirmed medicinal value
