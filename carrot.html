                     The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in color, though
                     purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist.[2][3][4] They are a domesticated form of the
                     wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated
                     in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of
                     the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten. The domestic carrot has
                     been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.

                     The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family, Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of
                     leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months
                     (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days).
