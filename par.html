                     The starches in parboiled rice become gelatinized, then retrograded after cooling. Through
                     gelatinization, amylose molecules leach out of the starch granule network and diffuse into the
                     surrounding aqueous medium outside the granules[6] which, when fully hydrated are at maximum
                     viscosity.[7] The parboiled rice kernels should be translucent when wholly gelatinized. Cooling
                     brings retrogradation whereby amylose molecules re-associate with each other and form a tightly
                     packed structure. This increases the formation of type-3, resistant starch which can act as a
                     prebiotic and benefit good health in humans.[8] However, this also makes the kernels harder and
                     glassier. Parboiled rice takes less time to cook and is firmer and less sticky. In North America
                     parboiled rice is either partially or fully precooked before sale. Minerals such as zinc or iron
                     are added, increasing their potential bio-availability in the diet.
