                     White rice is milled rice that has had its husk, bran, and germ removed. This alters the flavor,
                     texture and appearance of the rice and helps prevent spoilage and extend its storage life. After
                     milling, the rice is polished, resulting in a seed with a bright, white, shiny appearance.

                     The milling and polishing processes both remove nutrients. A diet based on unenriched white rice
                     leaves many people vulnerable to the neurological disease beriberi, due to a deficiency of thiamine
                     (vitamin B1).[1] White rice is often enriched with some of the nutrients stripped from it during
                     its processing.[2] Enrichment of white rice with B1, B3, and iron is required by law in the United
                     States.[3][4] As with all natural foods, the precise nutritional composition of rice varies
                     slightly depending on the variety, soil conditions, environmental conditions and types of
                     fertilizers.
