                     Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains, roots, beans, nuts, or seeds. Flours are used to
                     make many different foods. Cereal flour, particularly wheat flour, is the main ingredient of bread,
                     which is a staple food for most cultures. Corn flour has been important in Mesoamerican cuisine
                     since ancient times and remains a staple in the Americas. Rye flour is a constituent of bread in
                     central and northern Europe.

                     Cereal flour consists either of the endosperm, germ, and bran together (whole-grain flour) or of
                     the endosperm alone (refined flour). Meal is either differentiable from flour as having slightly
                     coarser particle size (degree of comminution) or is synonymous with flour; the word is used both
                     ways. For example, the word cornmeal often connotes a grittier texture whereas corn flour connotes
                     fine powder, although there is no codified dividing line.
