                      Paprika (American English more commonly /pəˈpriːkə/ (About this soundlisten),[1] British English more commonly /ˈpæprɪkə/ (About this soundlisten)[2]) is a ground spice made from dried red fruits of sweeter varieties of the plant Capsicum annuum.[3] It is traditionally made from Capsicum annuum varietals in the Longum group, which also includes chili peppers, but the peppers used for paprika tend to be milder and have thinner flesh.[4][5] In many languages, but not English, the word paprika also refers to the plant and the fruit from which the spice is made, as well as to peppers in the Grossum group (e.g. bell peppers).[6][7]:5, 73

The peppers used in making paprika originate from North America, in particular Central Mexico, where they have been cultivated for centuries. The peppers were subsequently introduced to the Old World, when peppers were brought to Spain in the 16th century. The seasoning is used to add color to many types of dishes in diverse cuisines
