                     The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum,[1][2] commonly known as a tomato
                     plant. The species originated in western South America and Central America.[2][3] The Nahuatl (the
                     language used by the Aztecs) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the
                     English word tomato derived.[3][4] Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have
                     originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.[2][5] The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking
                     at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the
                     tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe.
                     From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the
                     16th century.
