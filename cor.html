                     Coriander (/ˌkɒriˈændər, ˈkɒriændər/;[1] Coriandrum sativum) is an annual herb in the family
                     Apiaceae. It is also known as Chinese parsley, dhania or cilantro (/sɪˈlæntroʊ, -ˈlɑːn-/).[2] All
                     parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds (as a spice) are the parts
                     most traditionally used in cooking.

                     Most people perceive the taste of coriander leaves as a tart, lemon/lime taste, but to nearly a
                     quarter of those surveyed, the leaves taste like dish soap, linked to a gene which detects some
                     specific aldehydes that are also used as odorant substances in many soaps and detergents
                     All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the parts most
                     traditionally used in cooking, Coriander is used in cuisines throughout the world.
                     The dry fruits are coriander seeds. The word "coriander" in food preparation may refer solely to
                     these seeds (as a spice), rather than to the plant. The seeds have a lemony citrus flavour when
                     crushed, due to terpenes linalool and pinene. It is described as warm, nutty, spicy, and
                     orange-flavoured.
