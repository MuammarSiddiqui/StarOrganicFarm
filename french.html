                     The lentil (Lens culinaris or Lens esculenta) is an edible legume. It is an annual plant known for
                     its lens-shaped seeds. It is about 40 cm (16 in) tall, and the seeds grow in pods, usually with two
                     seeds in each. As a food crop, the majority of world production comes from Canada and India,
                     producing 58% combined of the world total. In cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, where lentils
                     are a staple, split lentils (often with their hulls removed) known as daal are often cooked into a
                     thick curry/gravy that is usually eaten with rice or rotis.In 2018, global production of lentils
                     was 6.3 million tonnes, led by Canada with 33% and India with 25% of the world total (table).[8]
                     Saskatchewan is the most productive growing region in Canada, producing 95% of the national
                     total.[9][10] In India, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are largest producers with both producing
                     more than 70 percent of the total. Other major producers include West Bengal and Bihar.s
